Estimated time: 4 hours

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Provision infrastructure using IaC and OCI Resource Manager.
* Leverage **Quick create** to deploy a new OKE cluster.
* Deploy resources and get to know how Kubernetes operates on OCI.
* Work with Kubernetes Virtual Nodes.
* Explore fundamental operations and administration functions in Kubernetes.
* Implement tools to enforce security, governance, and observability of your cluster.
* Build infrastructure and automate build/deployment of a Cloud Native Python application.
* Clean up the infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

1. An Oracle Free Tier (Trial), Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
1. [Familiarity with OCI console](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/console.htm)
1. [Familiarity with the basics of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
1. [Overview of Networking](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm)


## Cloud Native Applications Overview

> Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
>
> These techniques enable loosely-coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.
