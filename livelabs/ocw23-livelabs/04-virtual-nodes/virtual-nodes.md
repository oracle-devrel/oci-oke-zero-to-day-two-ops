# Working with Virtual Nodes

## Introduction

OKE virtual nodes deliver a complete serverless Kubernetes experience. With virtual nodes, you can ensure reliable operations of Kubernetes at scale without needing to manage any worker node infrastructure. This cluster option provides granular pod-level elasticity and pay-per-pod pricing, while eliminating the operational overhead of managing, scaling, upgrading, and troubleshooting worker nodes’ infrastructure. Kubernetes clusters become fully managed. Oracle manages clusters’ control plane and data plane for you. You’re responsible only for the applications deployed through the cluster’s Kubernetes API.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will deploy a second OKE cluster that utilizes Virtual Nodes, a feature that precludes any need to manage underlying compute infrastructure for your worker node pools. 

## Task 1: 



You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
